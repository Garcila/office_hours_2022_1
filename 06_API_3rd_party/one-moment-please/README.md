# MomentJS

In this activity, you will perform date conversions using Moment.js.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and do the following:

  * Import Moment.js

  * Convert the `randomDate` to the "MM/DD/YYYY" format using `moment()` and set it to a variable called `convertedDate`. Log it into the console. 

  * Convert `convertedDate` into three other date formats of your choice using `.format()` and log them into the console.

  * Calculate the time in years, months, days between today and the `convertedDate` using `.toNow()` and `.diff()` and log them into the console. 

  * Calculate the number of days between the `convertedDate` and 02/14/2001 and log it into the console. 

  * Determine what day of the week and what week of the year the `convertedDate` falls on and log them into the console. 

## Hint(s)

* You may need to consult the [Moment.js docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/); more specifically the [Moment.js Format documentation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) and the [Moment.js Difference documentation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/difference/)
