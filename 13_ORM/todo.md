## Libraries

- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) - [Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)
  > ORM sits between the server's API endpoints and the SQL database to translate and normalize data between JavaScript and SQL.
  - Don't write your own SQL queries. We have provided queries
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

- [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) ðŸ›‘

  > allows you to hash passwords. Hashing is the process of taking input and using a mathematical formula to chop and mix it up to produce an output of a specific length. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that it can easily convert input to a fixed-size output, but it is difficult to invert, or convert in the opposite direction. This attribute allows developers to secure passwords when authenticating users for their applications.
