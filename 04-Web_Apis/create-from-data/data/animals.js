		description:
			"Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, the lion is the second largest cat in the world. It is dwarfed slightly by the tiger, which is closely related and has a very similar body typeUnlike other cats, lions are very social animals. They live in groups, called prides, of around 30 lions. A pride consists of up to three males, a dozen related females, and their young. The size of the pride is determined by the availability of food and water. If resources are scarce, the pride becomes smallerPride members keep track of one another by roaring. Both males and females have a very powerful roar that can be heard up to 8 km (5 mi. away.Males and females take on very different roles in the pride. Male lions spend their time guarding their territory and their cubs. They maintain the boundaries of their territory, which can be as large as 260 sq. km (100 sq. mi.), by roaring, marking it with urine, and chasing off intruders. Their thick manes, a unique trait to male lions, protect their necks when they fight with challengers.",

They have the ability to use tools, learn new skills and show various signs of self-awareness.Spider monkeys get their name because of their long arms, legs and tail.The monkey is the 9th animal that appears on the Chinese zodiac, appearing as the zodiac sign in 2016.",

		name: "Peacock",
		species: "Bird",
		description:
			"Peacocks are large, colorful pheasants (typically blue and green) known for their iridescent tails. These tail feathers, or coverts, spread out in a distinctive train that is more than 60 percent of the bird’s total body length and boast colorful eye markings of blue, gold, red, and other hues. The large train is used in mating rituals and courtship displays. It can be arched into a magnificent fan that reaches across the bird's back and touches the ground on either side. Females are believed to choose their mates according to the size, color, and quality of these outrageous feather trains.Peacocks are ground-feeders that eat insects, plants, and small creatures. There are two familiar peacock species. The blue peacock lives in India and Sri Lanka, while the green peacock is found in Java and Myanmar (Burma). A more distinct and little-known species, the Congo peacock, inhabits African rain forests.Peafowl such as the blue peacock have been admired by humans and kept as pets for thousands of years. Selective breeding has created some unusual color combinations, but wild birds are themselves bursting with vibrant hues. They can be testy and do not mix well with other domestic birds.",

They have saved countless lives.Pigeons achieved a 98% success rate in the missions flown in WW II, despite enemy fire, and often with mortal injuries to themselves.In the World Wars, flying pilots carried pigeons in case they had to ditch their plane, they would release the bird for help.  Many pilots owe their lives to a pigeon.Pigeons are still used today by the French, Swiss, Israeli, Iraqi and Chinese Armies.Pigeons proved valuable in the Gulf War, as their messaging was not affected by the electronic jamming.Pigeons have been bought for as much as $132,000.00 by Louella Pigeon World in 1992. Invincible Spirit They have been proposed to be used by the Project Sea Hunt (U.S. Coast Guard) to spot life jackets out in the open sea.Noah's Dove was most likely a homing pigeon.They were used by many for communication before the telegraph was invented.They were used by the Greeks more than 5,000 years ago.They can and are ready to breed at the age of 5 to 6 months.They can breed as old as 10 years of age, and have been helped to breed past that.They are bred, raised and trained as good as Thoroughbred Horses.",

Deaths from spider bites are rare however.An abnormal fear of spiders is called ‘arachnophobia’.Tarantulas are large and often hairy spiders, the biggest species have been known to kill mice, lizards and birds.Most tarantula species pose no threat to humans.The largest specie of tarantula is the Goliath Birdeater.Giant Huntsman spiders have leg-spans of around 30cm (12 in).",

			"A tortoise's shell is made up of 60 different bones all connected to each other The top of a tortoise's shell is called a “carapace” The underside of the shell is called a “plastron” The carapace and the plastron of a tortoises shell is connected by what is known as a bridge Tortoises can retract their heads and all their limbs including their tails into their shells when they feel threatened or attacked by predators Tortoises have extremely strong mouths but no teeth instead they have horny type beaks Tortoises have good all round vision and a very good sense of smell Tortoises are cold-blooded – they draw heat from their environment and are more active during the day than at night Tortoises can live a very long time, some to the ripe old age of 150. However, the average age a tortoise can live to ranges from 90 to 150 years Tortoises are what is known as herbivores, they eat grass, ferns, flowers, tree leaves and fruit Female tortoises are usually larger than their male counterparts Females dig burrows in which they can lay up anything from 1 to 30 eggs A male tortoise has a longer tail than that of a female, which is one way of sexing them When baby tortoises break out of their shells they are called hatchlingsTortoise eggs incubate between 90 to 120 days to hatch out Tortoises hibernate in the winter time and before they do, they starve themselves so their stomachs are empty ready for hibernation",
