# TDD and OOP

## Going Forward

- Path going forward. Where are we in the Bootcamp and where are we heading

## We'll try to go over these topics along with OOP and Testing

- Spread - Destructure - Rest needs examples - can I use on front end

## OOP

## ☕️

- What is Object Oriented Programing

  - 📖 Wikipedia. '...programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects"...'

  - 😰 P5js? will this be on the test? [bubbles](https://editor.p5js.org/Garcila/sketches/J_1OppMn7)

  - 🤖 Robot
    - Object literal
    - Constructor ES5
    - Class ES6 - SubClasses...Inheritance

- Concepts
  - Objects Literals vs ES5 vs Classes
    - One object, copy the literal for many then use constructors then classes
    - Class = BluePrint - Cookie mold
    - Object = Instantiated version of a Class - 🍪
  - Classes
    - Properties
    - Methods
    - Constructors
    - Instaitiation
    - Inheritance

## Testing

### TDD - Test Driven Development

- Write tests before writing code. First failing tests and the write code to make them pass

- 🔴 🟢 re-🏭

- [jest](https://jestjs.io/)

  - npm i --save-dev jest ?why save dev?
  - script on package.json = jest

- [jest hints](https://devhints.io/jest)

- toBe (Primitive)
- toEqual (Deep comparison)
- toBeFalsy
- toBeLessThan
- toHaveLength
- toContain
